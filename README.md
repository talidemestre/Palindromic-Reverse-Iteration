# Palindromic-Reverse-Iteration
A website for the investigation of n-step palindrome generators with integer numbers. Typically hosted at http://palindrome.taliesindemestre.com/.  
The primary purpose of this project is to assist my grandfather in his investigation into the strange nature of n-step reverse palindromes and more specifically into Lychrel numbers, you can learn more about them at http://datagenetics.com/blog/october12015/index.html.
