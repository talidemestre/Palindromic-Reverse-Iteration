# Palindromic-Reverse-Iteration
A website for the investigation of n-step palindrome generators with integer numbers. Typically hosted at http://palindrome.taliesindemestre.com/.
The primary purpose of this project is to assist my grandfather in his investigation into the strange nature of n-step reverse palindromes and more specifically into Lychrel numbers, you can learn more about them at https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=mathmidexppap .
