  <h1>What I've Found Out</h1>
  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    Over the course of this investigation I've demonstrated many well known properties of Lychrel numbers. I have also
    revealed a number of behaviours of Lychrel numbers that have either never been previously seen or are tucked away in
    other obscure corners of the web. The counting of digits in partial application of the Lychrel process to 196
    demonstrated there is no bias towards any given digit in this sequence. A similar counting of digits in the first
    115,752 Lychrels did however demonstrate a positive biaas towards higher digits. An application of the Lychrel
    process to precision decimal point numbers has demonstrated its validity holds up for many decimals. An analysis of
    the distance between adjacent Lychrels shows the shortening distance and increasing frequency of Lychrels as we
    approach larger and larger integers. A reverse application of the Lychrel process revealed that for many Lychrels
    the process will work in reverse, yet highlighted that for some the process does not work in either direction. An
    analysis of the symmetricity of the Lychrel process highlights that for any partial application of the Lychrel
    process on integers, a semi-symmetric number will be formed. Finally, while an investigation into the universality
    of digits in the Lychrel process applied to 196 showed that there were no universal digits, it did however reveal
    that the process eventuates to every digit being present in every number formed.
